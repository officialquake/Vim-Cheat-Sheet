Introduction:
Vim is a text editor, just like sublime text, visual studio code, brackets and is usually much faster than most text editors as it uses hjkl, to move around, it uses several commands to get around and use the vim interface. Under this, I have listed the commands that are mainly used:

:help keyword = open help for keyword
:o file       = open file
:q!  = force quit
:wq        = save quit



CURSOR MOVEMENT

{        = moves to previous paragraph (or function/block, when editing code)
zz       = center cursor on screen
Ctrl + b = move back one full screen



INSERT MODE
i        = insert before the cursor
I        = insert at the beginning of the line
a        = insert (append) after the cursor
A        = insert (append) at the end of the line
o        = append (open) a new line below the current line
O        = append (open) a new line above the current line
